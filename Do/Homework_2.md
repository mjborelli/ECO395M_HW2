A Hospital Audit
================

Introduction
------------

The main goal of this statistical analysis is to audit the performance
of your radiologists for mammogram screenings. Each doctor wants to
limit the amount of false positives and false negatives as much as
possible, but mammograms are not perfect. Therefore, it is reasonable to
not expect 100% accuracy from your radiologists. However, we can utilize
statistical analyses in order to see how efficient the radiologists are
at recalling patients. Using the data you provided, approximately 1000
mammogram screenings from five randomly selected radiologists, we want
to examing two important questions for you:

-   Are some radiologists more clinically conservative than others in
    recalling patients, holding patient risk factors equal?
-   When the radiologists at this hospital interpret a mammogram to make
    a decision on whether to recall the patient, does the data suggest
    that they should be weighing some clinical risk factors more heavily
    than they currently are?
